Sales Summary Using SQLite and Python
Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to extract and visualize basic sales data from a SQLite database using Python. It calculates total quantity sold and total revenue per product and displays the results using a table and a bar chart.

Tools Used

Python (>=3.7)

SQLite (built-in with Python)

Pandas (for data handling)

Matplotlib (for plotting)

Files

sales_summary.py – Python script to generate the sales summary and bar chart.

sales_data.db – SQLite database file containing the sales table.

sales_chart.png – Optional bar chart image generated by the script (if saving is enabled).

How to Run

Make sure Python and required libraries are installed:

pip install pandas matplotlib


Run the Python script:

python sales_summary.py


The script will:

Connect to sales_data.db.

Summarize total quantity sold and total revenue per product.

Print the results in the console.

Display a bar chart of revenue by product.

Sample Output

Console Table:

   product  total_qty  revenue
0   Apples         15    37.50
1  Bananas         30    36.00
2  Oranges         23    41.40


Bar Chart:

X-axis: Product

Y-axis: Revenue

Notes

The database is created automatically if it does not exist.

Dummy data is inserted for demonstration; you can replace it with your own sales data.

You can modify the script to save the chart as an image by uncommenting plt.savefig("sales_chart.png").
